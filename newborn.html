    <h1>Short Story: Newborn</h1>

<p>
  Joshua Bannek couldn't sleep. Again. He lay in bed for a few minutes, trying to pull himself together.</p>
<p>
  "Calm down. It was just a dream."</p>
<p>
  He got up slowly, trying not to wake his wife. It wasn't necessary. Though she had always been a light sleeper, for the past few weeks she had been sleeping like the dead.</p>
"D*mn it!" Joshua thought. "Bad choice of words."

<p>
  Joshua let the cold water run in the sink, filled his hands with it, and washed his face. The circles under his eyes made him look old and tired. He looked in the mirror and gave himself a wry smile.</p>

<p>
  "Living on two hours' sleep a night; what the hell do you expect?"</p>

<p>

  Joshua walked to the kitchen and started to pour himself a drink, but stopped. Maybe a strong cup of coffee would be better. Yes, he had to stay awake. That was the only way the dreams would stop. It was funny that he always called them dreams. Really there was only one dream, the same dream over and over again.

His wife Cindy would be in labor, screaming and in so much pain. There would be no doctors, just the two of them in a room and the baby's head starting to come out. Somehow it wasn't until the baby was out completely that he could see. Where the back of his head should have been was a face. It was actually a second head, small and fused onto the main one. It had a face, malformed and evil-looking. It had only one eye that blinked at him. He would start to scream and then get up, looking for something. He would find it, a heavy brass figurine that Cindy kept near the bed. He would raise it up high and, ignoring her screams, smash the baby's head. Both of them. As the blood dripped out of the hideous mouth, Joshua would wake up.

Joshua hadn't told his wife about the dreams. He couldn't. First of all, she would insist that he seek help to get to the bottom of his fears that their child would be deformed. And what was the point of all that? He already knew why he was afraid. If Cindy knew the whole story, she would probably think it was a guilty conscience at work. But Joshua felt no guilt.
</p>
<p>"I'm a man. A man has needs."</p>

<p>Yes, needs. The need to have a wife at home and a mistress on the side, the need to not have a b*stard child, especially when his wife was pregnant. Angela was horrified when she learned that Joshua was married, but she loved children and would have loved and cared for their child with or without his support. In spite of his demands, she had no intention of aborting it. So of course Joshua felt justified in taking matters into his own hands.

He wasn't about to do it himself, but luckily there is never a shortage of those kinds of men to do those kinds of jobs. Enthusiastic as they were about their job, they almost killed Angela. But Joshua didn't want her dead, just the unborn child. He tried to be indignant and berate the men for having gone too far, but how could he complain? They had done their job.

Joshua had finished his coffee and was wide awake, so he knew he wasn't dreaming when he heard his wife scream for him from their bedroom.
</p>
<p>"Josh, it's starting!"</p>

<p>Joshua ran to the bedroom, heart pounding and afraid.</p>

<p>"Josh, it's starting!"</p>

<p>Cindy was calm, even smiling through her obvious pain.</p>

<p>"I've got to call the doctor." Joshua tripped over something as he headed for the phone.</p>

<p>"Honey, there's no time. This little kid wants out now. Just stay here. Everything will be ok."</p>

<p>Joshua stood there as his wife pushed. He felt very helpless and it all seemed a little unreal. Then he saw the head.

Joshua moved to the foot of the bed and with another few pushes the baby was out completely. It seemed so normal from the front, a sweet little boy who looked like his father. Then he turned the baby's head and it was just like his dream. There was the second head, the eye, and the mouth, and Joshua started to scream.

He looked frantically until he found it--the brass figurine that Cindy kept near the bed. He raised it above his head and took one more look at the monstrosity in front of him, the punishment for his sin. The eye looked up at him and blinked. Joshua smashed the head, both heads, with the figurine. He smashed them over and over again, until something stopped him.
</p>
<p>"Joshua, what are you doing? <em>Are you crazy?</em>"</p>

<p>His wife held his hands, taking the figurine away.</p>

<p>"I had to, Cindy. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I had another baby and I killed it. That's why this happened."</p>

<p>"Joshua, what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"The baby, it was deformed. Didn't you see it?"</p>

<p>Cindy stared at him. As she picked up the baby, Joshua could see his face, a perfect, sweet, tiny version of his own. As Cindy placed the lifeless body over her shoulder, Joshua saw the back of its head. He looked for the second head, the single eye, and the twisted mouth, but saw nothing but a crushed skull, covered with blood.</p>
